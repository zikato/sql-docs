# Use Table-Valued Parameters (Database Engine)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Table-valued parameters are declared by using user-defined table types. You can use table-valued parameters to send multiple rows of data to a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement or a routine, such as a stored procedure or function, without creating a temporary table or many parameters.

Table-valued parameters are like parameter arrays in OLE DB and ODBC, but offer more flexibility and closer integration with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. Table-valued parameters also have the benefit of being able to participate in set-based operations.

[!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] passes table-valued parameters to routines by reference to avoid making a copy of the input data. You can create and execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] routines with table-valued parameters, and call them from [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] code, managed and native clients in any managed language.

## <a name="Benefits"></a> Benefits

A table-valued parameter is scoped to the stored procedure, function, or dynamic [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] text, exactly like other parameters. Similarly, a variable of table type has scope like any other local variable that is created by using a DECLARE statement. You can declare table-valued variables within dynamic [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements and pass these variables as table-valued parameters to stored procedures and functions.

Table-valued parameters offer more flexibility and in some cases better performance than temporary tables or other ways to pass a list of parameters. Table-valued parameters offer the following benefits:

- Do not acquire locks for the initial population of data from a client.
- Provide a simple programming model.
- Enable you to include complex business logic in a single routine.
- Reduce round trips to the server.
- Can have a table structure of different cardinality.
- Are strongly typed.
- Enable the client to specify sort order and unique keys.
- Are cached like a temp table when used in a stored procedure. Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], table-valued parameters are also cached for parameterized queries.

## <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions
To create an instance of a User-Defined Table Type or call a stored procedure with a Table-valued parameter the user must have EXECUTE and REFERENCES permissions on the type, or on the schema or database containing the type.


## <a name="Restrictions"></a> Restrictions

Table-valued parameters have the following restrictions:

- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not maintain statistics on columns of table-valued parameters.
- Table-valued parameters must be passed as input READONLY parameters to [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] routines. You cannot perform DML operations such as UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT on a table-valued parameter in the body of a routine.
- You cannot use a table-valued parameter as target of a SELECT INTO or INSERT EXEC statement. A table-valued parameter can be in the FROM clause of SELECT INTO or in the INSERT EXEC string or stored procedure.

## <a name="BulkInsert"></a> Table-Valued Parameters vs. BULK INSERT Operations

Using table-valued parameters is comparable to other ways of using set-based variables; however, using table-valued parameters frequently can be faster for large data sets. Compared to bulk operations that have a greater startup cost than table-valued parameters, table-valued parameters perform well for inserting less than 1000 rows.

Table-valued parameters that are reused benefit from temporary table caching. This table caching enables better scalability than equivalent BULK INSERT operations. By using small row-insert operations a small performance benefit might be gained by using parameter lists or batched statements instead of BULK INSERT operations or table-valued parameters. However, these methods are less convenient to program, and performance decreases quickly as rows increase.

Table-valued parameters perform equally well or better than an equivalent parameter array implementation.

## <a name="Example"></a> Example

The following example uses [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] and shows you how to create a table-valued parameter type, declare a variable to reference it, fill the parameter list, and then pass the values to a stored procedure in the AdventureWorks database.

```sql
/* Create a table type. */
CREATE TYPE LocationTableType 
   AS TABLE
      ( LocationName VARCHAR(50)
      , CostRate INT );
GO
/* Create a procedure to receive data for the table-valued parameter. */
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo. usp_InsertProductionLocation
   @TVP LocationTableType READONLY
      AS
      SET NOCOUNT ON
      INSERT INTO AdventureWorks2012.Production.Location
         (
            Name
            , CostRate
            , Availability
            , ModifiedDate
         )
      SELECT *, 0, GETDATE()
      FROM @TVP;
GO
/* Declare a variable that references the type. */
DECLARE @LocationTVP AS LocationTableType;
/* Add data to the table variable. */
INSERT INTO @LocationTVP (LocationName, CostRate)
   SELECT Name, 0.00
   FROM AdventureWorks2012.Person.StateProvince;
  
/* Pass the table variable data to a stored procedure. */
EXEC usp_InsertProductionLocation @LocationTVP;
```
